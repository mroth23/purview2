Purview in C++

## Building From Source

First make sure that you have [CMake](http://www.cmake.org/) and a C++ compiler environment installed.
A recent version of Clang++ or G++ should do. It needs to support C++14.

Further, you will need to have the following dependencies installed:
- ImageMagick 7 (for Magick++)
- Boost > 1.46

Then open a terminal, go to the source directory and type the following commands:

    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ cmake ..
    $ make
